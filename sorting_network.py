"""Implementation of the batcher oddâ€“even mergesort

Non-power of two sizes are realized by generating the next larger power of two
shrinking the resulting network by removing items at the end. It's safe to
remove them as we can imagine the prefix contains items smaller than any other
and the suffix items larger than any other. In that case no comparator would
ever move those items.
